=== INSTRUCTIONS ====

== Testing the app ==

Just run a regular 'grails test-app'. This will run several unit specs and one functional spec (sorry, I didn't have enough time to add more functional specs).

IMPORTANT: you need to have Google Chrome installed for the functional spec to run.



== Running the app ==

Run 'grails run-app'. On the home page you'll find two options:

# View all accounts: allows the user to see a list of all accounts in the system and their balances (Acceptance Criteria #1) and
    provides a link for the selection of account, in which page the list of transactions can be visualized (AC #2).

# Transfer sum: enables the user to perform a transfer of a given amount between 2 accounts (AC #3, 4, 5)
